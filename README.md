## DataSet

This project uses the Taxi Service Trajectory (Mosquera-Lopez et al., 2023). The dataset originates from the ECML-PKDD 2015 Taxi Trajectory Prediction Challenge. It contains detailed trajectories of 442 taxis operating in Porto, Portugal from 01/07/2013 to 30/06/2014. The data was collected via GPS trackers installed in the taxis. Each tripâ€™s trajectory was recorded, capturing GPS coordinates at 15-second intervals, along with other contextual metadata about the trip. 

For the purposes of this project, resource and time constraints, we have sampled 200,000 rows from the original dataset

The sampled dataset can be retreived by contacting the authors

## Running the models

taxi_eda.ipynb contains the code to clean the dataset
taxi_net_trajectory is the model for predicting the next location
